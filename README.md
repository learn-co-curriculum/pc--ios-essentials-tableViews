## Objectives

1. Connect a series of view controllers with *show* segues.
2. Embed a stack of view controllers in a navigation controller.


## Segues

To allow your user to navigate between view controllers, a path between them called a **segue** (pronounced "seg-way") can be created in your storyboard. We are going to learn one of the most commonly used â€” the *show* segue.  

## `UINavigationController`

A navigation controller is special view controller that provides a navigation toolbar at the top of the screen and *contains and manages* a stack of view controllers. The navigation controller automatically provides a back button when there is more than one view controller in its stack.

#### *Show* Segues

Go back to the storyboard. Add a show segue between the first two view controllers in the stack: select the button which reads `Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.` and `control`+`drag` a line to the second view controller containing the question `What is your name?`. Select *show* in the menu that pops up and a show segue will be created between this button and the next view controller.

#### Embed in Navigation Controller

Let's put our stack of view controllers into a navigation controller. In the storyboard, select the initial view controller which is left-most in the stack and symbolized with the arrow facing into the left side of the view controller. Then in the Xcode taskbar, open the `Editor` menu, hover over the `Embed in >` sub-menu and select the `Navigation Controller` option.
